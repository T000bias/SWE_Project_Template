## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

### Section 1: Introduction
- Many of the courses in the Engineering Technology Division will require you to submit your solution to analysis problems, design problems, and laboratory exercises using a formal written report. These reports are similar to those you will encounter as a young engineer and are intended to develop your ability to effectively communicate the results of your work to others. The purpose of this document is to set the standards for written work submitted in the Engineering Technology Division.

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Section 2: Standards Common to all

- 1. General:

        - Technical engineering reports are formal presentations of analysis solutions, design solutions, or test results.

        - To be useful, the report must clearly and concisely communicate the results of your work.

        - The technical report should not contain superfluous or unsupportable material.

        - Each word should be essential and used in a clear and understandable manner. 

        - Quality, not quantity, is the key to a successful report.

        - Since technical reports often serve the needs of both technical personnel and upper level management, they should be carefully organized to strike a balance between technical accuracy and completeness on one hand, and readability and conciseness on the other. 

        - This balance is usually best achieved by making the main body of the report a complete, yet concise, overview of the problem and its solutions; relegating most of the supporting data and pertinent detail to supporting appendices. However, THE BODY OF THE REPORT MUST STAND ALONE; i.e., it is the controlling document which ties together the entire report and directs the reader to any other part of the report.

        - Paragraphs 2 and 3 below contain guidance for all formal technical reports for analysis problems, design problems, and laboratory exercises.

- 2. Specifics

        - a. Technical Reports will be submitted in a hardboard theme binder. The name(s) of the author(s) will be on the front of the binder.

        - b. All narrative portions of each submission will be prepared using a commercial word processing system and printed on standard 8.5” x 11” paper. All machine or manual printing must be clearly legible.

        - c. Writing will be on one side only and will be double-spaced.

        - d. Sequentially number all pages. Start the Title Page with page i (Roman Numerals) and start the Introduction with page 1 (Arabic Numerals).

        - e. A minimum LEFT margin of 1.5” must be observed on all pages to ensure readability of the report after it is bound. All other margins will be at least ONE inch. This includes figures, tables, and computer printouts.

        - f. Equations found in the main report will be numbered sequentially for each reference. They may be handwritten.

        - g. Sample calculations and supporting mathematical derivations/calculations are normally located in appendices. Such calculations may be handwritten in pencil. In actual practice, pencil work is often photocopied to avoid unauthorized tampering with the final legal document.

        - h. All oversize pages will be cut to 8.5” x 11” or folded neatly to that dimension. As an exception, oversized pages may be grouped together in a special binder capable of holding oversized pages. In all cases, pages will be attached so that they may be read without disassembling the report and should not face into the binding nor be obscured by the binding.

        - i. In general, pages will be oriented vertically. If a page is presented so that it must be turned 90 degrees to read, it should be placed in the binder with the top of the page at the binding so that the reader will have to turn the report clockwise to read the page.

        - j. Use figures and tables to communicate information more clearly. Whenever a figure or table is used in a report, it must be discussed in the report’s body. Such discussion should specifically point out to the reader the main points illustrated. Do not vaguely refer to a figure and expect the reader to do the interpretation. All figures and tables will have complete descriptive titles that distinguish them from all other figures or tables. Titles to computer-generated figures may be added neatly by hand in ink, typed directly onto the figures, or cut and pasted into the correct location.

            - (1) Figures. Figures consist of drawings and/or graphs supporting the body of the report. Descriptive titles for figures appear at the BOTTOM of the figure. Figures will be numbered sequentially, independently of table numbering. See Appendix F for a sample of a properly labeled figure.

                - (a) Drawings. Drawings will be titled as “Figures”. Drawings must be done neatly. If done by hand, they will be done with a sharp pencil using a straightedge, compass, or French curve. Alternatively, the use of computer-generated graphics is highly encouraged. Drawings are normally done to scale. The scale should be noted and critical dimensions should be labeled. If it is impractical to prepare drawings to scale, this fact should be clearly noted by writing “NOT TO SCALE” near the drawing.

                - (b) Graphs. Graphs will be titled as “Figures”. The axes of the graph will be completely labeled, to include units. The scale will be clearly shown along each axis. If more than one curve is shown, a legend is required that clearly differentiates one curve from another. Labeling key points on a curve is highly recommended to make discussion of the graph clear.

            - (2) Tables. Descriptive titles for tables appear at the TOP of the table. Tables shall be numbered sequentially, independently of figure numbering. Column headings for tables should include appropriate units. See Appendix G for a sample table.

        - k. Sample calculations are required in almost all instances to document or verify results. They are especially important in verifying computer-generated results with representative data from the problem.

- 3. Organization. 

        - The following pages or sections appear in a complete Technical Report for analysis problems, design problems, and laboratory exercises.

        - a. Title Page. 
            - A sample title page is found in Appendix A.

        - b. Abstract. 
            - The abstract is a one page summary of the entire report to include the conclusion. It should answer the “why, how, and how well?” questions about the report.This is usually the very last section of the report to be written. The abstract must be written as a stand-alone document and must convey to the reader the essence of the report. It allows the reader the choice whether to read the remainder of the report for details.

        - c. Table of Contents. 
            - This lists all important report sections and appendices along with page numbers. When listing appendices, a descriptive title will be included. See Appendix B for a sample Table of Contents.

        - d. List of Tables. 
            - This is a list of all tables in the report, their descriptive titles and page numbers. Titles should state what is in the table and clearly define the situation to which the table pertains. A sample List of Tables is found in Appendix C.

        - e. List of Figures. 
            - This is a list of all figures in the report to include drawings and graphs, their descriptive titles, and page numbers. The figure’s title should state what is shown in the figure and clearly define the situation to which the figure pertains. A sample List of Figures is found in Appendix D.

        - f. List of Symbols. 
            - This is a list of any abbreviation or symbol used in the report along with its definition and units. It is arranged alphabetically with English letters first, then Greek symbols, and then other symbols. A sample List of Symbols is found in Appendix E.

        - g. Body of the Report. 
            - The main sections in the body of the report vary with the purpose of the report. However, most technical reports for analysis problems, design problems, and laboratory exercises contain many common elements. Specific guidance concerning technical reports for analysis and design problems is given in Section III, and for laboratory exercises in Section IV.

        - h. Works Cited. 
            - The works cited portion of the technical report (often called a “bibliography”) lists all outside sources used to complete the report. See Appendix H for a sample “Works Cited” section.

        - i. Appendices. 
            - The effective use of appendices enhances the readability and coherence of the main body of the report. Appendices are the proper place for presentation of the details supporting the body of the report. Appendices are appropriate for large amounts of tabulated data, annotated sample calculations, detailed mathematical derivations, and other supporting material which may be essential to the completeness of 5the report, but which would be distracting or unwieldy if placed in the main body. Sufficient information is given in the appendix so that another engineer would be able to reproduce your results. The main body of the report must reference all appendices. Each appendix will have its own cover sheet listing the same title specified in the report’s table of contents. Each appendix will be tabbed on its cover sheet for easy reference by the reader.

### Section 3: Body of Report for Design or Analysis Problems

- A complete Technical Report for a Design Problem or Analysis Problem includes those items discussed in Section II above. The organization of the body of the report for a design or analysis problem follows. It represents a logical method of presenting your results that works effectively in most cases. If you feel another organization would more effectively communicate your results, see your instructor.

    - 1. Introduction. The introduction is a concise statement of the purpose and background of the analysis/design problem. This is a brief background on the subject to tell the reader why the design or analysis was performed. The introduction should give only the background information with a minimum of detail. Equations and calculations are rarely used in this section unless they are absolutely necessary. References often are used to point out previous work accomplished that is historically important to this report. In a design problem, you should also list the specifications and requirements of the design along with any constraints of the problem.

    - 2. Assumptions. This is a listing of the conditions which, in addition to the known facts, are considered essential to the completeness and validity of the report. Assumptions should be kept to the minimum required and must always be realistic. Assumptions listed in this section should relate to the overall problem. Assumptions relating to a specific procedure or equation should be presented in the “General Approach” section in conjunction with presenting that procedure or equation. Assumptions are sometimes required to bridge gaps in factual information which cannot be obtained through research within the required time.

    - 3. General Approach. This section develops the general solution procedure which should lead to and support the results, discussion, conclusion, and recommendation stated in subsequent paragraphs. It completely explains the logical, theoretical, approach to solving the design or analysis problem. It may include the principal equations essential to the analysis, their assumptions, and their impact on the solution of the problem. All methodology is completely explained. The report writer should consider the following when developing this section:
        - (a) Derivations or references for the governing equations can be included. Lengthy derivations should be placed in an appendix and referred to from this section.

        - (b) Short sample calculations might be included here, but are commonly found in an appendix and referred to from this section.

        - (c) Do not make this section a chronology of what you have done or a long, blow-by-blow, cookbook-type description of the solution technique used. However, the reader should feel confident from the description of your approach that you have followed a sound solution procedure.

    - 4. Results and Discussion. 
    
    This section presents the end products of the design or analysis process. This is not the place to be brief. This is the thinking and reasoning part of the report. The report writer should consider the following when developing this section.

        - (a) Results must be presented in a conspicuous manner.

        - (b) If applicable, present a logical appraisal of the various alternative means by which to solve the stated problem based upon an objective evaluation of the pertinent facts.

        - (c) Results should be discussed and compared in a factual manner.
        - (d) It is often appropriate to use summary tables and graphs to present the supporting evidence used in this section. Remember, every table and graph presented in this section must be discussed.
        - (e) A sensitivity analysis may be appropriate in reporting the results in this section.
        - (f) An opinion of the validity of the results may be appropriate.
        - (g) The effects of any assumptions on the results may be addressed in this section.

    - 5. Conclusions. 
    
    This section should be thought of as a summary which emphasizes the findings of your work. Better yet, it is a summary of the results and discussion section. In effect, this section contains the answer to the problem statement. Keep the following points in mind as you develop this section of the report.

        - (a) There should be no new information here that has not been previously developed and discussed in the previous sections of the report.

        - (b) A reader should be able to go directly from the introduction to this section to determine if the report contains findings of interest.

        - (c) Summarize your conclusions concisely, preferably in itemized form.
        
        - (d) In a design problem, the conclusion states the final choice for the design, with complete engineering specifications.

    - 6. Recommendations. 
    
    Recommendations are courses of action not previously stated in the conclusion section that have a bearing on the problem. Recommendations, IF ANY, should follow from the conclusions. In addition, other recommendations which significantly improve the outcome of the report (or the overall analysis/design process) should be presented. Did you consider a certain effect negligible that is not negligible?
    Do you suspect your analysis may be oversimplified and further study is warranted? Other areas of consideration may also be mentioned and could include suggestions for further study or improvement.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

**Note: Delete this note and replace the list above with resources that helped you during the challenge. These could come in handy for anyone viewing your solution or for yourself when you look back on this project in the future.**

### Section 4: Body of Report for Laboratory Exercises

    - A complete Technical Report for a Laboratory includes those items discussed in Section II above. The organization of the body of the report for a laboratory follows. It represents a logical method of presenting your results that works effectively in most cases. If you feel another organization would more effectively communicate your results, see your instructor.

    - 1. Introduction. The introduction is a concise statement of the objective (what are you to determine?), purpose (why are you conducting the laboratory?), and assumptions used during the experiment. Conclusions made later in the report must be based upon the stated objectives. The listed assumptions may include any major limitations imposed during the experiment or those needed to simplify or reduce the scope of the experiment.

    - 2. Theory. This section completely and concisely explains the logical, theoretical approach to conducting the laboratory experiment. It should include the principal theoretical equations essential to the conduct of the laboratory. Derivations or references for the governing equations can be included; however, lengthy derivations should be placed in an appendix and referred to from this section.

    - 3. Experimental Procedures. This section of the report contains a brief description of the laboratory procedures followed in conducting the experiment. Controls used during the experiment, frequency of readings, equipment used, and general procedures are contained in this section. The reader should be able to follow the conduct of the experiment from this section. Any need to expand upon the lab procedure that might be considered too lengthy should be included in an appendix.

    - 4. Results and Discussion. This section of the report presents the experimental results and observations. This section should also include a discussion of possible erroneous data and possible sources of error in the experiment. The laboratory report writer should consider the following when developing this section:

           - (a) Results must be presented in a conspicuous manner.
            - (b) Results should be discussed and compared in a factual manner.
            - (c) Discuss disagreement between the laboratory and theoretical results.
            - (d) It is often appropriate to use summary tables and graphs to present the supporting evidence used in this section. Remember, every table and graph presented in this section must be discussed.
            - (e) Sample calculations and supporting evidence in support of this section is normally presented in appendices.
            - (f) An opinion of the validity of the results may be appropriate.
            - (g) A sensitivity analysis may be appropriate in reporting the results in this section.
            - (h) Uncertainty and percent error calculations supporting the error analysis are usually included in an appendix and discussed in this section.

    - 5. Conclusions. This section of the report correlates the results with the objective of the experiment. Keep the following points in mind as you develop this section of the report:
        - (a) There should be no new information here that has not been previously developed and discussed in the previous sections of the report.
        - (b) A reader should be able to go directly from the introduction to this section to determine if the report contains findings of interest.
        - (c) Summarize your conclusions concisely, preferably in itemized form.
        - (d) Conclusions should be based on the current experimental effort and not on other results found in the literature.
    - (e) If recommendations are appropriate, they may be included in this section or provided as a separate section.


- [Section 5: Homework]()

    - The following guidelines are to be followed when preparing homework in these courses. These guidelines are meant to establish a level of neatness and quality in engineering computations that will help the student in organization, and enable others to follow your reasoning and your work to be checked. Homework that does not follow these guidelines will be graded poorly.

    - I.Format
        -  A. Use 8½ by 11 paper, with engineering paper being preferred. Use only the front side of the paper. No ragged edges will be acceptable.

        - B. Label homework with name and date in the upper right hand corner. Each page should, at minimum, include your initials, date and page number.

        - C. Set up the problem in the form of Given, Required and Solution. Clearly identify each problem and assignment. The ‘cut and tape’ method using a photocopy from the text or handout is also acceptable. A sketch or drawing should include labeling dimensions. Use a ruler.

        - D. All Work should be done in pencil.

    - II.Problem Solution

        - A. Write legibly and neatly (use a ruler for straight lines.) Do not try to put all the problems onto one page. If a page becomes hard to read due to a lot of erasing, rewrite the page. Figures should be large enough to allow all dimensions and design details to be clearly labeled.

        - B. Write all equations in symbol form before substituting values and note the text/specification equation number.

        - C. Include all units in equations and in the final answer.

        - D. State all assumptions and provide reference for equations and values that are not obvious. E.g. Table numbers and page numbers, etc.

        - E. Clearly indicate the answer by enclosing in a box or underlining twice.

        - F. All text should be printed or typed. Use proper grammar.

    - III.Graphing
        - A. Use either graph paper or engineering paper for graphs. Use log-log or semi-log paper for all graphs requiring the use of a log scale.

        - B. Label all graphs with a title, legend, axis labels and units.
        - C. Data points must be shown with symbols.
        - D. Computer generated graphs from a spreadsheet program are preferred.

    - IV.Computer Solutions
        - A. Indicate the name and version of the program being used.
        - B. Clearly indicate what was input to the program and the results that were obtained.A sketch for the input and a graph from the output are often useful. Unless in the form described in section II above, output directly from the computer does not constitute an acceptable solution. The output should be attached as an appendix, but with the results summarized and given in a readily understandable form.
        - C. Where appropriate, such as with a spreadsheet, provide sample calculations.

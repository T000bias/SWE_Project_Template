Title of Your Essay

Start the first paragraph here, which should introduce your reader to the subject you are
writing about. Do not label this paragraph as ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù Instead, simply write your paper‚Äôs
title as a level 1 heading: bold, centered, with title case. To learn more about what an
introduction should include, see the following resource: Introductions &amp; Conclusions. You can
use this template to help you format your paper. For longer papers, include level headings as
you will see throughout this paper to help guide the reader through your paper. Your thesis
statement should go at the end of your introduction.

The Writing Process

Spend time planning your paper. A good practice is to brainstorm and research ideas and
decide how to express the main idea or thesis and what to include. Once you have a rough idea of
what you want to discuss or argue, create an outline or to help you organize your paper and the
evidence you plan to present in each body paragraph.

Writing the Body Paragraphs

Always begin with a topic sentence in your own words. We have several resources to
help you write a strong body paragraph, such as How to Write a Body Paragraph and the
Integrating Research (UAGC Writing Center, 2019). Evidence is provided as the supporting
sentences in each body paragraph. As mentioned by UAGC Writing Center (2019), an in-text
citation must be used when providing information from a source into your paper‚Äîsee next
section. End each body paragraph with your own ideas or analysis on the topic of the paragraph.

Using Citations Correctly

In addition to being well-written, each paragraph should include an in-text citation to all
information and evidence that is summarized, paraphrased, or quoted from outside sources. The University of Arizona Global Campus Writing Center (2019) provides many resources to help you follow correct citation style and gives lessons and examples of how to paraphrase and cite
sources. There are two ways that you can format an in-text citation: parenthetical or narrative. A
parenthetical citation saves all the information for the end of the sentence (Author, Year).
However, a narrative citation includes the Author (Year) ‚Äúearlier in the sentence and saves the
location information for the end, keeping in mind that a page number is required for a direct
quote, but not for a paraphrased sentence‚Äù (p. ##). If you do not have a page number for your
type of source, you can find information on citing it in the in-text citation guide.
Level 2 Heading (Bold, Flush Left, Title Case)
Level headings can be placed anywhere in your paper as a way to classify or organize
your paper into sections. There are five levels; the first three levels are more commonly used in
graduate-level assignments, whereas levels four and five may be used in longer papers (e.g.,
dissertation). Use level 2 headings to break level 1 into categories, level 3 to break up level 2,
and so on. Do not move to a lower level of heading if there is only one section. As a general rule,
check with your instructor about formatting expectations.
Level 3 Heading (Bold, Flush Left, Italic, Title Case)
Likewise, to show your readers where the paragraph begins when using a level 3 heading
would be a great idea.
Level 4 Heading (Bold, Indented, Title Case). In longer papers, you may use a level 4
heading to create even further subsections. In this case, note that the paragraph begins directly
after a period on the same line as the level 4 heading. The level 5 headings follow the exact same
conventions, only they would also be italicized.

Using Tables, Graphs, Images, and Appendices

For some papers and reports, you may choose to add a table, graph, or image
within the body of the draft. Or you may choose to include an appendix at the end of your paper.
These can help to provide a visual representation of data or other information that you wish to
relay to your reader. Follow this guidance to understand when and how to use these features.

Conclusion

You only need to label the conclusion with a heading as shown here if you have a lengthy
paper and have included headings for each section. Otherwise, you can simply begin your
conclusion as your final paragraph in your paper. The conclusion should do more than
summarize what you‚Äôve stated already‚Äîit should also include the importance or significance of
the topic under discussion. Learn more about writing a strong conclusion

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.
